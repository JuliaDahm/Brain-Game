# README

Originally designed database to contain nested attributes so users could
own questions and points could be deducted from their scores if other users
rated them poorly. After struggling to implement nested attributes using
a nested form, looked back over the documentation and realized this wasn't what
the assignment called for. With little time left, dropped the original Trivia
and Answers table set up to allow multiple choice options,
and replaced with a singular Questions table containing a string answer
with intention to check against the users, using string matching. As you'll see,
there's plenty left to be built out. I focused my attention on setting up
seemingly solid authentication and validations. Had I more time, I would have
written a function to check the users answer and update their score. Also, would
have moved from rendering Question views and implemented AJAX
for same-screen use of CRUD actions in the Dashboard view, including live score updates.
I then would have deployed to Heroku and written out documentation noting the dependencies.

I understand my project leaves something to be desired, but I feel this serves
as a sufficient representation of my understanding of Rails.
I do not think the fundamentals of Rails are outside my working knowledge,
but I do personally feel that if I was given an opportunity to work in a team environment,
my mistakes would likely be caught earlier on and
my strengths could be used to forward the project more efficiently.

I appreciate your interest in me and thank you for the opportunity.
Any and all feedback is welcome.

Sincerely,
Julia
